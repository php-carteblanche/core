CarteBlanche - Documentation
============================

>   The PHP MVC framework of Les Ateliers, simple, light-weight and easy to use for PHP developments.

>   <http://github.com/php-carteblanche/carteblanche>

## Presentation

**CarteBlanche** is a PHP framework constructed as an MVC application ready to work. It uses
a core library of classes that are enough to make it work and allows to develop some
extra features quickly in this environement.

It holds `bundles`, some packages to execute a feature, that could be exported after development
as a standalone PHP package (if so) ; it also proposes a set of `tools`, pretty simple
PHP classes, one per feature, to help building views.

The rendering is integrated in a ready-to-use (but very simple) global template coded in HTML5.


## Installation & Usage

### Installation

The package to install is [carte-blanche/carte-blanche](https://github.com/php-carteblanche/carteblanche).

Once you have downloaded or cloned the package sources, the installation is quite simple. It requires
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install its dependencies. Please see the "Dependencies" section
below for more informations about Composer, what it is and what it does.

Installation steps:

1.   put the whole CarteBlanche directory in your web-server files system ; you can download
     an archive at <https://github.com/php-carteblanche/carteblanche/archive/master.tar.gz>
     or clone GIT sources running in a command line terminal:

        ~$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/php-carteblanche/carteblanche path/to/CarteBlanche
        // or, if you have an old version of GIT without the 'recursive' option:
        ~$ git clone https://github.com/php-carteblanche/carteblanche path/to/CarteBlanche
        ~$ cd path/to/CarteBlanche
        ~$ git submodule update --init

2.   go to the CarteBlanche root directory:

        ~$ cd path/to/CarteBlanche

3.   install dependencies running the `bin/build.sh` script:

        ~$ ./bin/build.sh install
        // or, if you need to configure Composer or PHP binaries to use:
        ~$ ./bin/build.sh -h

4.   CarteBlanche is ready !

### Usage

As in many other frameworks, the PHP and binary sources are separated from the assets, web
accessible stuff. Basically, all the web files (javascripts, css, images and other assets)
are stored in the `www/` sub-directory. All other files may NOT be web-accessible. The PHP
sources are mostly stored in the `src/` sub-directory.

To access the framework's controller from a web-browser, just load the `index.php`
file from the `www/` directory of CarteBlanche. A development version of this controller is
predefined and accessible loading the `dev.php` file instead of `index.php`.

A terminal controller is also defined, for command line usage only, you can access running:

    ~$ php bin/console

### Documentation

See the `doc/` directory contents for documentations about configuration, structure and
usage.


## Rules & Dependencies

### Coding Rules

To build a comprehensive and maintainable code, we try to follow the coding standards and
naming rules most commonly in use:

-   the [PEAR coding standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php)
-   the [PHP Framework Interoperability Group standards](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards).

Knowing that, all classes of the framework are named and organized in an architecture to follow the 
usage of the [standard SplClassLoader](https://gist.github.com/jwage/221634).

### Dependencies

As explained in the "Installation" section above, this package uses some other third-party packages
to be compliant with the common standards of actual PHP development. In addition to [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/),
required for its classic installation, CarteBlanche proposes a set of other external PHP packages used for development
and a set of external assets packages used for the HTML5 rendering.

To install all PHP packages for development, just run:

    ~$ ./bin/build.sh --set=dev install
    // or, using Composer itself
    ~$ composer install --dev

A PHP documentation tool is available generating it with [Sami](https://github.com/fabpot/Sami). To build or
re-build it, you will need to run Composer in development environment (*just as shown above*) and then run:

    ~$ ./bin/build.sh render-doc
    // or, using Sami itself
    ~$ php src/vendor/sami/sami/sami.php render config/vendor/sami.config.php
